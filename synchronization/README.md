/kernel/orientation.c
## Data structure
```c
struct orientevt {
	bool status;				/*indicate if event is within range*/
	bool close;				/*indicate if event is destroeyd*/
	unsigned int evt_id;			/*event_id managed by IDR*/
	atomic_t num_proc;			/*number of blocked processes*/
	struct orientation_range *orient;	/*orient range assigned by orientevt_create*/
	wait_queue_head_t blocked_queue;	/*blocked processes attached to this event*/
};
```
## Locks
A IDR lock for orientevt and locks inside **add_wait_queue**, **prepare_to_wait** and **finish_wait**.

## Mechanism
**set_orientation**:Update status in every struct orientevt and if it is active wake up wait queue.
<br><br>
**orientevt_create**:Create struct orientevt and link orientevt with unique ID by IDR.
<br><br>
**orientevt_destroy**:Remove corresponding struct orientevt from IDR. After making sure no process is blocked on this event(indicated by num_proc) it will free the space.
<br><br>
**orientect_wait**:If the event exists, create struct wait_queue and synchronize with orientevt. If event is active or event is destroyed it will leave wait queue. Particularly if event is destroyed, it will return -EFAULT.
## Test program
Test process will fork 4 child processes. Two of them follow facing up event while others follow facing down. After TEST_SEC it will close these two events to let child process exit.
## Test result
Lock seems work properly because I noticed the syscall order may change sometimes:
<br>
1:facing up!
<br>
2:facing up!
<br>
2:facing up!
<br>
1:facing up!
<br>
1:facing up!
<br>
2:facing up!
